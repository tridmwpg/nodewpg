        <h1>1C:Small Business</h1>
        <p>1C:Small Business is a business software solution capable of automating most activities in any small company’s workflow, including purchases and sales, manufacturing, production, customer service, project management, and much more.</p>
        <h2>General features</h2>
        <div align ="center"><img src = "img/1c_small_business_overview.png"></div>    
        <p>This highly versatile new software from 1C Company is free of redundant functionality and is easily customized to match your company's accounting and management practices. It offers a user-friendly interface and "quick-start" capability. 1C:Small Business increases company efficiency by offering a wide range of management tools to decision makers as well as facilitating the daily activities of employees. 1C:Small Business can be downloaded in an open-source format.</p>
        <P>1C:Small Business eliminates the need to store dozens of spreadsheets, documents, and reports across your desk and computer memory. All data is recorded and stored in a single database.</P>
        <p>1C:Small Business is capable of recording all your company’s inventory transactions and other events, both scheduled and completed. These can include (but are not limited to) obligations to customers, customer orders, order statuses, employee tasks, planned resource allocation, job sheets, and production and sales quotas.</P>
        <h3>A single infobase includes:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>a customer database,</li>
            <li>banking and cash operations, online banking, and payment schedules,</li>
            <li>settlements with counterparties and payments to employees,</li>
            <li>material, inventory, and product accounting,</li>            
            <li>customer orders and job orders,</li>
            <li>work and service planning and accounting,</li>
            <li>production activity planning and accounting,</li>
            <li>production load planning,</li>
            <li>commercial operations (such as retail sales),</li>
            <li>human resources and payroll management,</li>
            <li>cost and management accounting,</li>
            <li>assets and capital,</li>
            <li>profits and losses,</li>
            <li>financial planning (budgeting),</li>
            <li>and more.</li>
        </ul>    
        <p>The application includes forms for entering almost any standard document for trade, inventory, or production accounting, or for cash flow.</p>
        <p>A wide variety of reports quickly provides business owners, managers, and employees with all the data they need in an easily readable format and with a customizable level of detail.</p>
        <p>1C:Small Business is not intended for payment and taxes accounting, for which 1C:Accounting should be used instead.</p>
        <p>The application is capable of providing service to multiple companies or individuals operating in a single area of business. Should the business’s scale or structure, management processes, or company workflow change, the application can be reconfigured quickly and inexpensively to reflect these changes.</p>
        <p>1C:Small Business is recommended for companies with up to 10 workstations.</p>
